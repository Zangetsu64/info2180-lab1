        <p>As a computing major, I had a natural interest in technology and the dynamics of how everything worked, 
            including the internet. The average person who uses the internet on a daily basis would just interact with 
            already built webpages and other components of the internet. Learning how the webpages are built and styled 
            so that users get the best browsing experience would be extremely valuable. In undertaking this course 
            (COMP2180) I hope to at least learn the fundamentals of web devolopment and be able to put any newly learnt 
            skills to practical use. </p>
